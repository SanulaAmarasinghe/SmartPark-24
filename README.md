# Smart Parking System with PowerApps

This repository contains the implementation of a **Smart Parking System** developed using **PowerApps**. The system utilizes IoT sensors to provide real-time updates on parking spot availability, which are then displayed in a mobile application built on PowerApps.

## Features

- **Real-Time Parking Availability:** Users can view available parking spots in real-time through the mobile app.
- **Vehicle Information:** The system allows users to retrieve details about parked vehicles, including the owner's information.
- **PowerApps Integration:** The mobile app is built using PowerApps, enabling a low-code solution for rapid development and easy integration with IoT sensors.

## Technologies Used

- **PowerApps:** For building the mobile application and creating a user-friendly interface.
- **IoT Sensors:** For detecting available parking spaces and sending real-time data to the app.
- **Cloud Services (Optional):** For storing and retrieving parking and vehicle data.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up IoT sensors to detect parking spot availability and integrate them with PowerApps.
3. Configure PowerApps components and connect to the necessary data sources.
4. Run the mobile app on your device to start using the system.
